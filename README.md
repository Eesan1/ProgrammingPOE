This is a application made of C# allows users to create and manage thier own recipes. Users can type in ingredients with quantities and units, add preparation steps, scale the recipe, reset quantities to their original values, clear all data and exit the application.

How to use the application:

Run the application: Compile and run the Program.cs file. The application will prompt you to type in the details for your recipe.

Type in ingredients: Type the number of ingredients, then for each ingredient, type its name, its quantity, its unit of measurement, its calorie amount per unit, and its food group.

Type in steps: Type the number of steps needed for the recipe, then describe each step.

See the final recipe: After entering all details, the created recipe will be displayed.

Then an list is displayed with the following options:
•	Add a new recipe: This will allow the user to enter the details of a recipe, this is repeated when you finish recording a recipe.
•	Display a specific recipe: This will display one recipe based on the name and show you the next option list.
•	List all recipes that were recorded: This will display the names of all the recipes recorded.
•	Exit: This will allow the user to exit the application

The next list that is displayed when you display a recipe includes the following:

•	Scale the recipe: This will enter a scale factor (0.5, 2, or 3) to adjust the quantities of ingredients based on this.
•	Reset Quantities: This will reset ingredient quantities to their original values.
•	Clear all the data: This will clear all data that was entered and start a new recipe.
•	Return to main menu: This will return the user back to the first list.
•	This application was made on visual studio code, thus i recommend using visual studio to run it. I have noticed that cmd runs it best.
